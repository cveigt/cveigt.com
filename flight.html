        <p>
          When I joined the design system core team at HashiCorp, they were
          working on introducing a standalone icon library. As I love designing
          icons and had experience working with icon systems, I quickly took
          ownership of the library.
        </p>
      </section>

      <!-- Problem Section -->
      <section class="project-section">
        <h2>Workflow</h2>
        <p>
          We leveraged Figma's REST API to create a script that fetches the
          icons from the published Figma file, then transforms them into SVGs,
          making them as easy to consume for engineers as they are for
          designers, while keeping them in sync.
        </p>
        <img
          src="images/project-flight-image-01.png"
          alt="Flight Icon System Workflow"
          class="showcase-image"
        />
      </section>

      <!-- Icon Creation Section -->
      <section class="project-section">
        <h2>Icon creation</h2>
        <p>
          To ensure consistency across icons, we established some high-level
          design guidelines and a process for drawing, adding, and publishing
          new icons.
        </p>
        <img
          src="images/project-flight-image-02.png"
          alt="Flight Icon Creation Process"
          class="showcase-image"
        />
        <p>
          Since our script loops over each icon or element present in the
          library file during the build process, I have a separate development
          file where the icon creation happens. Once an icon has been made,
          reviewed, approved, and is ready to be added to the library, I add a
          flattened and optimized version to the production file and keep the
          original in the development file for future reference or updates.
        </p>

          src="images/project-flight-image-03.png"
          alt="Flight Icon Creation Process"
          class="showcase-image"
        />
        <img
          src="images/project-flight-image-08.png"
          alt="Flight Icon Creation Process"
          class="showcase-image"
        />
      </section>

      <!-- Figma Library Section -->
      <section class="project-section">
        <h2>Figma library</h2>
        <p>
          The Figma library publishes two sizes of each icon, following a
          consistent naming convention and categorized into three different
          categories: Core, Product, Services, and Animated.
        </p>

      </section>

      <!-- Code Library Section -->
      <section class="project-section">
        <h2>Code library</h2>
        <p>
          We automated the build process and used GitHub actions to run our
          script. Then, I open a pull request, which is then merged and
          released.
        </p>
        <img
          src="images/project-flight-image-06.png"
          alt="Flight Figma Library"
          class="showcase-image"
        />
        <p>
          Once a new package is available, the new icons are added to the icon
          section of the documentation website.
