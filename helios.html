          HashiCorp provides consistent workflows to provision, secure, connect,
          and run any infrastructure for any application.
        </p>
        <p>
          In 2022 HashiCorp introduced their Cloud Platform to provide managed
          versions of HashiCorp's infrastructure automation tools, allowing
          organizations to leverage the power of their products without managing
          the underlying infrastructure themselves.

        <h2>Problem</h2>
        <p>
          Building a platform that not only relies on the CLI but also on
          dedicated dashboards and complex workflows demanded a design system
          that could scale with the platform and their standalone products as
          well.

      <!-- Solution Section -->

        <h2>Solution</h2>
        <p>
          A new initiative was launched to build a robust and scalable design
          system to serve the entire suite of products, with a focus on the
          cloud platform as the pilot.

        <h2>My role</h2>
        <p>
          I joined as part of the team assembled to build and maintain the
          system. As a member of this small team, my role as a system designer
          was to help establish the foundations, build and document accessible
          components, collaborate with other product designers and engineers,
          provide support, and advocate for the design system.

        <h2>Strategy</h2>
        <p>
          After conducting an exhaustive audit of the existing UI, we decided to
          start with color, typography, and elevation as a starting point for
          the foundations. This approach allowed us to experiment and define not
          only the foundations but also the token architecture.

      <!-- Process Section -->
      <section class="project-section">
        <h2>Process</h2>
        <p>
          Our process for building components is broken down into six steps:
        </p>

        <img
          src="images/project-helios-image-04.png"
          alt="Component building process overview"
          class="showcase-image"
        />

        <h3>Component audit</h3>
        <p>
          I conduct an audit across our products together with our design and
          engineering ambassadors. This helps inform the design and requirements
          of the component or pattern.
        </p>

        <h3>Project kickoff</h3>
        <p>
          This is used to align on project scope, timelines, milestones, and as
          a space to discuss any open questions. We use a kickoff document and a
          CRD (Component Requirements Document) as artifacts to communicate
          decisions and align on accessibility, API, architecture, etc.
        </p>

        <h3>Component design</h3>
        <p>
          At this stage, I start to explore and experiment, going through
          different types of reviews with designers, engineers, and other
          stakeholders as necessary. During this phase, we design and build the
          component in Figma as well as in code.
        </p>
        <figure>
          <img
            src="images/project-helios-image-12.png"
            alt="Component design process"
            class="showcase-image"
          />

            alt="Component design process"
            class="showcase-image"
          />
          <figcaption>Example of finished component, Alert.</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <h3>Component testing</h3>
        <p>
          Component testing allows other designers to test the Figma component
          and provide concrete feedback on whether what we are building is
          usable and meets the consumers' needs. For engineers, the process is a
          bit different as it is more challenging to have something up and
          running for them to test.
        </p>

        <h3>Documentation</h3>
        <p>
          In tandem with the component build process and testing, I start
          writing documentation directly in Markdown by opening a pull request
          in GitHub to have it reviewed by other members of the team, and
          eventually merge it to master. Our documentation artifacts include:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Design guidelines</li>
          <li>Specifications</li>
          <li>Relevant accessibility details</li>
          <li>Stickersheet and Figma tips as necessary</li>
        </ul>

      <!-- Results Section -->
      <section class="project-section">
        <h2>Results</h2>
        <p>
          Within the first year, we saw an uptick in design and development
          productivity and sprint velocity, especially in implementation time.
          While we decided to focus most of our efforts on one product, we
          started working with other teams on migrating or adopting the design
          system as part of our adoption strategy.
