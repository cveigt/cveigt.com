        <h2>Context</h2>
        <p>
          I joined the company in 2019. The core team decided to migrate the
          Portal front-end from Angular to React. Upon joining, I discovered
          that while there was purportedly a design system in place, upon closer
          examination of the design files and codebase, it became evident that
          it was more of a style guide and a React component library that did
          not seem to scale or be adopted across the platform.
        </p>
        <p>Some of the identified issues were:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Absence of a component library.</li>
          <li>
            Mismatch between the style guide and production implementation.
          </li>
          <li>Lack of a single source of truth.</li>
          <li>Custom components and styling.</li>
          <li>Lack of common patterns.</li>
          <li>Poor accessibility.</li>
          <li>Challenging designer-developer handoff.</li>
        </ul>

      <!-- Role & Problem Section -->
      <section class="project-section">
        <h2>My role</h2>
        <p>
          I was a solo designer leading efforts on the design side and
          supporting the front-end development team.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="project-section">
        <h2>Problem</h2>
        <p>The process from ideation to production was slow and painful.</p>

      <section class="project-section">
        <h2>Challenge</h2>

      <section class="project-section">
        <h2>Solution</h2>
        <p>
          While we lacked resources to build a fully-fledged design system, we
          decided to iterate over existing elements and focus more on shared
          language and less on processes and tools.
        </p>
      </section>

      <!-- Interface Inventory Section -->
      <section class="project-section">
        <h2>Interface inventory</h2>
        <p>
          After auditing our portal application, I found numerous
          inconsistencies in styles, particularly in colors and typographic
          hierarchy. Additionally, there were many accessibility issues and
          custom/recycled components that were meant to have the same appearance
          and behavior but did not.
        </p>

      <!-- Color Palette Section -->

        <h2>Color palette and mapping</h2>

          </figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
          Based on existing colors and brand guidelines, I reduced the number of
          shades and simplified the palette. Additionally, I adjusted some
          colors to meet accessibility standards (WCAG 2.1 level AA).

      <!-- Components Section -->
      <section class="project-section">
        <h2>Components</h2>
        <p>
          Since I was the sole designer working concurrently with other
          initiatives, the strategy for building or fixing components was to
          address them as needed for new projects. The scope was to fix or
          create the React component, its Figma counterpart, and add basic
          documentation.
        </p>

      <!-- Handoff Section -->
      <section class="project-section">
        <h2>Handoff</h2>
        <p>
          With limited development resources, I collaborated with various
          front-end developers depending on the project we were implementing at
          a given time. Consequently, the handoff process varied, as some
          engineers were less detail-oriented and some were more familiar with
          Figma than others.
        </p>

      <!-- Architecture Section -->
      <section class="project-section">
        <h2>Architecture</h2>
        <p>
          Until that point, styles and components for the product and website
          were separate in Figma but shared in the front-end. I decided to align
          the Figma library structure with this and reduce maintenance overhead.
        </p>

      <!-- Documentation Section -->
      <section class="project-section">
        <h2>Documentation</h2>
        <p>
          Since there were no plans to open-source or release this as a
          public-facing system and lacked resources for a dedicated
          documentation site, I set up a Notion space in a couple of days. This
          served as a place to document components, styles, and design
          decisions.

      <!-- Advocacy Section -->
      <section class="project-section">
        <h2>Advocacy and education</h2>
        <p>
          In addition to technical work, I shared concepts and best practices
          with designers and engineers less familiar with design systems, aiming
          to not only educate but also encourage usage and collaboration.
        </p>

      <!-- Results Section -->
      <section class="project-section">
        <h2>Results</h2>
        <p>
          Although we lacked a proper tool to measure results and impact, we
          used Jira metrics and anecdotal evidence from consumers for insights
          on improvements.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>~ 15% Improve in implementation time.</li>
          <li>Significant improvement in task completion rate.</li>
          <li>More efficient design <> developer collaboration and handoff.</li>

      <!-- Learnings Section -->
      <section class="project-section">
        <h2>Learnings</h2>
        <h3>Small changes can make a big impact</h3>
        <p>
          Establishing a shared language and a simple, well-architected
          component library improved communication between teams and increased
          efficiency.
        </p>

        <h3>Share the problem</h3>
        <p>
          Sharing problems and pains with developers fostered trust, empathy,
          and partnership beyond designers. One of the main reasons I attribute
          the success of this project is the help I got from engineers.
