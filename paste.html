        <h2>Context</h2>
        <p>
          Paste is known for its accessibility, architecture, and documentation.
          In 2018, I was one of the two designers who led the efforts to design
          and build the early version of Paste.
        </p>
        <p>
          In 2017, Twilio made a significant investment in the design
          organization, resulting in our team tripling in less than a year.
          However, our tooling and processes were not scaling properly, leading
          to bottlenecks and excessive overhead. The entire team relied on a
          Sketch file that was uploaded to a shared folder every time it was
          updated.

      <!-- Goals Section -->
      <section class="project-section">
        <h2>Goals</h2>
        <p>
          The initial plan for Paste was divided into two phases. We needed to
          deliver something quickly to help teams move faster and test its
          effectiveness. Thus, we focused on unifying styles and building a
          pilot Sketch library aligned with code components.

      <!-- Role Section -->
      <section class="project-section">
        <h2>My role</h2>
        <p>
          I worked at 50% capacity on this project concurrently with other
          product-focused projects. My responsibilities included:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Building the Sketch component library.</li>
          <li>
            Providing component specifications, guidelines, and assisting
            developers in building high-quality components.
          </li>
          <li>
            Proposing and helping establish processes to remove friction and
            improve the team's workflow.
          </li>
        </ul>

      <!-- Component Library Section -->
      <section class="project-section">
        <h2>Component library</h2>
        <p>
          For the library, I focused on components, starting with those in use
          and using our codebase as a guide rather than design files, as they
          proved to mismatch what was in production.

      <!-- Performance Issues Section -->
      <section class="project-section">
        <h2>Performance issues</h2>
        <p>
          Sketch performed poorly with large files at the time, prompting us to
          rethink the structure of the library. We decided to split it into
          separate files based on component types.
        </p>

      <!-- Documentation Section -->
      <section class="project-section">
        <h2>Documentation</h2>
        <p>
          Upon completing the initial version of the library, I worked on two
          important tasks:
        </p>
        <h3>Adding documentation</h3>
        <p>
          Initially in Figma, later expanding to more tailored guidelines on our
          public website.
        </p>
        <h3>Collaborating with engineers on improvements</h3>
        <p>
          Not only making components more flexible but also rethinking them in a
          holistic way and making changes accordingly.
        </p>

      <!-- Results Section -->
      <section class="project-section">
        <h2>Results</h2>
        <p>
          We released the new libraries, followed by several iterations based on
          feedback from designers and developers. We observed an increase in
          productivity, especially among designers.
        </p>
        <p>
          Following this release, we developed a dedicated site to provide
          documentation and resources to consumers and other stakeholders. We
          also launched an alpha version of the design system to gather broader
          feedback and intensify our efforts in adoption.
