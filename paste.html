        <h2>Context</h2>
        <p>
          Twilio is a customer engagement platform that enables developers to
          build unique communication experiences. Paste is Twilio's design
          system, providing the building blocks for creating consistent and
          accessible products.

      <!-- Role Section -->
      <section class="project-section">
        <h2>My role</h2>
        <p>
          As a design systems designer, I worked on creating and maintaining
          accessible components, collaborating closely with engineers and other
          designers to ensure high-quality implementation.
        </p>
      </section>

      <!-- Problem Section -->
      <section class="project-section">
        <h2>Problem</h2>
        <p>
          The challenge was to create components that were not only visually
          consistent but also met WCAG 2.1 accessibility standards while being
          flexible enough to serve multiple product teams' needs.
        </p>
      </section>

      <!-- Solution Section -->
      <section class="project-section">
        <h2>Solution</h2>
        <p>
          We established a robust component development process that included
          accessibility reviews, thorough documentation, and extensive testing
          to ensure our components met both design and technical requirements.
        </p>
      </section>

      <!-- Component Design Section -->
      <section class="project-section">
        <h2>Component design</h2>
        <p>
          Each component went through multiple rounds of design reviews,
          focusing on visual design, interaction states, and accessibility
          considerations.

      <!-- Implementation Section -->
      <section class="project-section">
        <h2>Implementation</h2>
        <p>
          Working closely with engineers, we implemented components using React
          and TypeScript, ensuring they were performant and met our
          accessibility requirements.

      <!-- Documentation Section -->
      <section class="project-section">
        <h2>Documentation</h2>
        <p>
          Comprehensive documentation was crucial for adoption. Each component
          included usage guidelines, props documentation, accessibility
          considerations, and examples.
        </p>

      <!-- Results Section -->
      <section class="project-section">
        <h2>Results</h2>
        <p>
          The system was successfully adopted across Twilio's product suite,
          leading to:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Improved accessibility across products</li>
          <li>Faster implementation time for product teams</li>
          <li>Consistent user experience</li>
          <li>Reduced design and development overhead</li>
