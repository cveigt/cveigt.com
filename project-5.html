          HashiCorp provides consistent workflows to provision, secure, connect,
          and run any infrastructure for any application.
        </p>
        <p>
          In 2022 HashiCorp introduced their Cloud Platform to provide managed
          versions of HashiCorp's infrastructure automation tools, allowing
          organizations to leverage the power of their products without managing
          the underlying infrastructure themselves.

        <h2>Problem</h2>
        <p>
          Building a platform that not only relies on the CLI but also on
          dedicated dashboards and complex workflows demanded a design system
          that could scale with the platform and their standalone products as
          well.
